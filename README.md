# ncsd_multi

Python modules to make your life easy while running `ncsd-it.exe`!

Main script is `ncsd_multi.py`.
You feed it a list of parameters,
and it'll run multiple ncsd jobs for you.

## Getting Started

`git clone` this, or if you're on Cedar you can find a clone in `exch`.

`git pull origin master` to get the latest version. 

Then you'll need to open `ncsd_multi.py` and enter a bunch of parameters:


```
    manual_params = MinParams(
        ...
        Z = 3,  # number of protons
        N = [5,6],  # number of neutrons
        hbar_omega = 20,  # harmonic oscillator frequency
        N_1max = 9,  # highest possible excited state of 1 nucleon
        N_12max = 10,  # highest possible state of 2 nucleons, added
        ...
    )
```

There are other parameters which are set by default.

The defaults can be changed by going to the very bottom of `data_structures.py`
and editing the inputs to `DefaultParamsObj`.


To do multiple runs, simply specify a variable as a list,
e.g. `Z = [3,4,5]` will make 3 different runs.

Make sure that your variables are well ordered if more than one is changing,
runs are created by list index!

If you have variables that change, but less than others,
keep in mind that lists are extended by copying their last entry.

So if you have

`Z = [1,2]`
`N = [1,2,3]`
`Nhw = 1`

you'll get 3 runs, with parameters

`Z = [1,2,2]`
`N = [1,2,3]`
`Nhw = [1,1,1]`


Note: make sure to edit the 3-body parameters if `abs(interaction_type) == 3`.

### Prerequisites

Just Python (3.7.4 ideally, other versions may work).

Also be sure the `templates` directory is present, the scripts need that.

No other libraries or downloads or anything are needed.

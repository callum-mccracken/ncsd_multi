ncsd_multi.py: facilitates running ncsd-it.exe with many nuclei

- takes sets of inputs for ncsd-it.exe runs
- then, for each run:
    - makes a folder so each run's output is contained, copies exe file
    - makes a bunch of mfdp.dat files to complete each run
    - runs each process at the end, if desired
